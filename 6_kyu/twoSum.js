/*
Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number.
It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value.
The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple / list (depending on your language)
like so: (index1, index2).

For the purposes of this kata, some tests may have multiple answers; any valid solutions will be accepted.

The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater,
and all the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different items from that array).

Based on: http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

twoSum([1, 2, 3], 4) // returns [0, 2] or [2, 0]
*/

const twoSum = (arr, int) =>{
    const result = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
            if (arr[i] + arr[j] === int){
                result.push(i, j);
                return result;
            }
        }
    }

 return undefined
}

console.log(twoSum([1,2,1,2], 4))
